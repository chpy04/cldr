Stable Links Info
This page contains information about updating the various stable links to part of CLDR and "latest" versions, etc. Most of the redirects are in the ".htaccess" file of http://www.unicode.org/cldr/ and some are in the /etc/apache2/httpd-rewrite.conf file on www.unicode.org. (Note: at this point, you should not have to touch cldr/.htaccess which should be stable, just the rewrite conf file.)
