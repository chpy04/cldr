Currency Symbols
Each currency code such as USD or EUR can be represented in several ways, as given in the table below. Be sure to look at the international symbol to see which currency is being translated. For example, the English examples below are for USD. The Symbol and International code will be used in number patterns, as shown in the Examples of Usage. For more information, see Number Patterns.
Note: in some cases, the English currency symbol may appear as box, typically because you don't have fonts for all of the characters. This is especially the case for currency symbols recently added to Unicode, such as the following:
