CLDR Development Site
Some of the key pages for developers are:
New CLDR Developers
Maven Setup (for command line & Eclipse)
Obsolete (but may still contain useful nuggets): Eclipse Setup
Eclipse (survey tool)
Handling Tickets (bugs/enhancements)
Updating DTDs
Editing CLDR Spec
CLDR: Big Red Switch (checklist for release)
Adding a new locale to CLDR
The subpages listed give more information on internal CLDR development. See also: Sitemap.
Note: when editing Sites pages it is often useful to clean up HTML in material pasted in from other sources, such as Word or Google Docs. Some useful regexes for that:
<(font|span|div)[^>]+> <$1>
style="[^"]*"
